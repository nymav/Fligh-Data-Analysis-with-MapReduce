# Flight Data Analysis with MapReduce ✈️📊

This project leverages MapReduce (Hadoop) and Oozie to analyze 22 years of US flight data. It identifies key patterns such as airline punctuality, airport taxi times, and cancellation reasons through a sequence of MapReduce jobs managed by an Oozie workflow.

## 📁 Project Contents

```bash
📄 flight.java        # Java MapReduce logic (3 jobs)
📄 flight.jar         # Compiled JAR for Hadoop execution
📄 workflow.xml       # Oozie workflow configuration
📄 command.txt        # Setup and execution steps for Hadoop, Oozie, MySQL
📄 output.txt         # Sample result from MapReduce jobs

## 📊 Output Summary

- **On-Time Airlines:** Identifies airlines with the highest and lowest probability of being on time.
- **Taxi Time:** Determines airports with longest and shortest average taxi time.
- **Cancellations:** Reports the most common reasons for flight cancellations.

Example:
```
Airlines with 100% on-time:
YV7958, YV7003, YV6790
Airlines with 0% on-time:
9E2072, 9E2076, 9E2102
```

## 🚀 How to Run (via Oozie)

- Ensure Hadoop and Oozie are installed and configured.
- Upload flight data and JAR files to HDFS.
- Submit Oozie job with `workflow.xml` and `job.properties`.
- Track job status via CLI or Oozie UI.
